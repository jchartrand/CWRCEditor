1) Start with a valid RelaxNG schema file.

2) Run it through normalize.xsl to normalize white space.

3) Use either of the following converters to get JSON and save to a file:
http://jsontoxml.utilities-online.info/
http://www.kawa.net/works/js/xml/objtree-try-e.html

4) Load the file and replace the define array with an object wherein the keys are the define entry names.
From the console use the following:

var newdef = {};
for (var i = 0; i < grammar.define.length; i++) {
	var d = grammar.define[i];
	newdef[d['-name']] = d;
}
var string = JSON.stringify(def);

Then copy paste the string into the file (removing the surrounding quotation marks).

5) Run XML through all_attributes.xsl and add the array as a child to grammar under the key 'attributes'.

6) Run XML through all_elements.xsl and add the array as a child to grammar under the key 'elements'.

7) Wrap grammar in an array so it can be loaded through an AJAX call.

8) Schema file should have this structure:
[{
	grammar: {
		define: {},
		start: {},
		elements: [],
		attributes: []
	}
}] 

9) When initializing the writer pass the url to schema file using they key 'schemaUrl'.
