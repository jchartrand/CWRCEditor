    <lg>
     <l>On the school platform, draping the folding seats,</l>
     <l>they wait the chairman's praise and glass of water.</l>
     <l>Upon the wall the agonized Y initials their faith.</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>Here all are laic; the skirted brothers have gone.</l>
     <l>Still, their equivocal absence is felt, like a breeze</l>
     <l>that gives curtains the sounds of surplices.</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>The hall is yellow with light, and jocular;</l>
     <l>suddenly some one lets loose upon the air</l>
     <l>the ritual bird which the crowd in snares of singing</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>catches and plucks, throat, wings, and little limbs.</l>
     <l>Fall the feathers of sound, like <foreign>alouette</foreign>'s.</l>
     <l>The chairman, now, is charming, full of asides and wit,</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>building his orators, and chipping off</l>
     <l>the heckling gargoyles popping in the hall.</l>
     <l>(Outside, in the dark, the street is body-tall,</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>flowered with faces intent on the scarecrow thing</l>
     <l>that shouts to thousands the echoing</l>
     <l>of their own wishes.) The Orator has risen!</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>Worshipped and loved, their favourite visitor,</l>
     <l>a country uncle with sunflower seeds in his pockets,</l>
     <l>full of wonderful moods, tricks, imitative talk,</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>he is their idol: like themselves, not handsome,</l>
     <l>not snobbish, not of the <foreign>Grande All√©e! Un homme!</foreign></l>
     <l>Intimate, informal, he makes bear's compliments</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>to the ladies; is gallant; and grins;</l>
     <l>goes for the balloon, his opposition, with pins;</l>
     <l>jokes also on himself, speaks of himself</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>in the third person, slings slang, and winks with folklore;</l>
     <l>and knows now that he has them, kith and kin.</l>
     <l>Calmly, therefore, he begins to speak of war,</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>praises the virtue of being <foreign>Canadien</foreign>,</l>
     <l>of being at peace, of faith, of family,</l>
     <l>and suddenly his other voice: <emph>Where are your sons?</emph></l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l>He is tearful, choking tears; but not he</l>
     <l>would blame the clever English; in their place</l>
     <l>he'd do the same; maybe.</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
     <l part="I">
      <emph>Where are your sons?</emph>
     </l>
     <l part="F">The whole street wears one face,</l>
     <l>shadowed and grim; and in the darkness rises</l>
     <l>the body-odour of race.</l>
