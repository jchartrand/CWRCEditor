                <p>I have had no letter from you since I left <placeName

                    envelope you had sent him. I had sent him one addressed to <placeName

                <p>When I reached Oslo yesterday evening, Brynjulf Bull should have been there to
                    meet me, but wasn't. He is not on the telephone, so I took a taxi to his
                    address, which turned out to be a students' club with no one about on Sundays,
                    so I went to a hotel feeling rather non-plussed. But presently he turned up. He
                    had got the <pb n="2"/> time of my arrival wrong, and <corr>when</corr> he had found he had
                    missed me he phoned to every hotel in Oslo till he hit on the right one. He left
                    me at 10, and then I had to do a <title

                <p>Bull is a nice young man but incompetent - can't quite stand the communists, but
                    finds the socialists too mild.</p>

                <p>I am unhappily wondering what you are feeling about me.</p>
