Answer: Most often you will want to use the date element over the dateStruct element. However, if you are certain an event occurred in a certain year but you are unsure of the day or month on which the event occurred, you will want to use a dateStruct to express differing degrees of certainty to the components that make up a date.

It is meant to indicate a specific, undated event that occurred sometime during a specified span of time.

For example, by using the places tagged with biography documents, we hope to generate a map for each woman writer's life which places her in specific places at specific times in her life. We also hope to allow end users to see a map of events for a particular year which would bring together geographical information from all Project DTDs. In order to automate mapping, it is crucial that we provide place information in a structured and recognizable way. In addition to mapping, we want to provide end users with an index of places. For example, we want to be able to index all women writers who lived in Bloomsbury or all events which took place in Bath.","While we prioritize the tagging of place, not all places require tagging. We hope to enhance our geographical information by context specific tagging. For example, by tagging only places where events occurred inside Event DTD chronstructs and not all places mentioned within the prose, we will be able to map that event to the place tagged. See Practice Issues below for a discussion of context specific practices.","Biography","Events","Writing","Place is the largest bucket holding together the subs dividing place into country, city, town, etc. All content information --- i.e., the names of places -- should be placed inside its subs. Place does allow free prose which can be used to leave unimportant locations untagged and to enter punctuation.","Place is a universal element available in all DTDs and within most elements. Place has the following content subs which divide place into smaller units: placename, address, settlement, region, and geog.","<place><settlement>Tokyo</>,<geog>Japan</</>","<place><settlement>Hanworth</>,<region>Middlesex</></>","She died at <place><address><addrLine>George Street</>, <addrLine>hanover Square</></>, <settlement>London</></>.","Sources: For problem places check Atlases available in your Project reference section.

Use you best judgement on determining relevant places but as a general rule, only tag places that are significant to a person's life and writing or an historical event. For example, if a woman writer lived in the village of Little Wittering, while the place is obscure, tag it as tagging it may allow us to discover that another woman writer lived or wrote there in a different century. But if the writer split up with a lover who then went off to live in Little Wittering, or if she applied for a job there but didn't get it, do not tag it.","Do not tag places within biography and writing documents that refer to general world events rather than the particular people when these events will be entered elsewhere. In the example below, tag Florence because Radclyffe Hall was in Florence during that time but do not tag the reference to Italy in the shortprose because WWII will be covered in an Events document.","<chronStruct><dateRange>6 November 1921-7 January 1922</><chronProse> RH and Una visited <place><settlement>Florence</><geog REG=\"Italy\"></></>, staying at the Hotel Albion.</></><shortprose><p> The sided with the Fascists in the midst of Italy's political upheaval.</></>","Do not tag the same place twice in one document unless it refers to two logically separate places. If she lived in London and you have tagged her move to London, all subsequent life events which take place in London do not require place tags. However, if she then moved to Bath and returned to London, tag the return to London.","All places must have a recognizable location tagged. In order to automate mapping, the computer will search from smallest to largest conceptual location (i.e., settlement to region to geog) and map the place according to the smallest recognizable place. Therefore, if the smaller conceptual name is not recognizable you must add a larger sub, even if it means using a place sub with only the reg attribute filled in (see below). If you do not know whether a place is recognizable and identifiable by itself, check with your supervisor. In the example below, do NOT simply tag British Museum. You must include the empty settlement tag for mapping purposes.","She had the idea for her novel standing on the steps of the <place><placeName>British Museum</><settlement REG='London\"></></>.","You must include a region sub for all places in the British Isles. See region glossary entry for a list of regions to use and a list of exceptions to this rule.","You must include a geog sub for all places outside the British Isles.

A common example of this occurs when adjectives are used instead of proper names and the proper name is given inside a reg attribute.","She met Eleanor Roosevelt during her <place><geog REG=\"USA\">American</> lecture tour.","You can use two of the same place subs within one place element in capturing information concerning a logically singular place. For example, if you wish to capture that she lived in the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, since both Rocky Mountains and Alberta are regions, capture them in two region subs. You can only do this when the place is logically one place (i.e., a settlement within a settlement) and not for references to logically different settlements (i.e., \"She travelled from London to Paris\" requires two place elements).","If a place has a specific directional marker (i.e., eastern, western, northern, southern), include that marker in the prose but regularize without the direction.","<place><geog REG=\"France\">southern France</></>","<place><geog REG=\"Asia\">Central Asia</></>","<place><settlement REG=\"London\">East London</></>","When a place sub is a given a reg or current attribute, the content of these attributes will take priority over the content of the element's prose for mapping and indexing.","All places tagged within a Div1 Location element within Biography will be assumed to refer to the place where the person was and will be mapped accordingly.","Only tag place in a chronstruct inside an Events document if it is the place where the chronology event occurred.","Only tag place in a chronstruct inside a Biography and Writing document if it can be used to map where the subject of the documents was on the date specified.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. Discussions of BWW's texts within the textual features section of writing documents do not require bibcits if they are the product of the Project member writing the document.","The Orlando Project's bibcits follow MLA style: Pedersen 90; Holton, Suffrage 107-8; qtd. in Hume 76. However, much of this information, including author's name, short title, and the abbreviation \"qtd. in,\" will be stored in attributes and rendered through various stylesheets. In its final form within an SGML document, the text of a bibcit will contain page numbers only, and may sometimes even be empty if no page number is required (in the case of one-volume alphabetically arranged reference books, for example).","BibCits go just inside the end tag of whatever piece of information they apply to. In events documents, for example, this will be the end tag for the whole chronStruct. Bibcits for ChronStructs should appear just before the closing tag; bibCits for chronEvents should occur just before the closing tag; and bibCits that refer to entire paragraphs should appear outside of the closing </p> tag but before the closing shortProse tag unless the bibcit is specific to a single para in a multi-paragraph shortProse in which case it goes inside</p>. You need to have a biibCit after each direct quotation, and please use them as frequently as necessary throughout the prose writing in your doc to make the job easier for source checkers.","This element is equivalent to other globally available elements such as title, keywordClass, scholarNote, and researchNote.The bibcit tag has three different attributes: BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER: the bibcit placeholder retains the text of the original, MLA-style bibcit. DBREF: the dbref, or database reference number, is the number of the corresponding bibliographic citation for the source cited; this number can be determined by looking up the source in the bibliography database.QTDIN: qtdin is available for those quotations which would be preceded by \"qtd. in\"; for example, if you are providing a quotation from a BWW and your source is a secondary source which imbeds this quotation within its own text. When you quote from a quoted passage in a secondary source (eg, a biography which quotes from diaries, letters, etc), then you choose the attribute \"qtd. in = yes\". This will get rendered down the road, probably as \"qtd. in,\" when the dbref numbers are converted to author name, short title format. You do not need to write in the words 'qtd. in\".","If you are writing documents, fill in the bibcit attributes as you proceed. As a courtesy to future source-checkers, provide the author and/or short title in both the bibcit placeholder and in the actual text of the bibcit proper; source checkers will delete this information from the bibcit text as they check each reference.","BibCits and Quotes:All quote tags should be followed by a bibCit as if the sentence had normal spacing without the bibCit.","It was originally opened by Queen Victoria as the People's Palace, a place of <quote Direct=y>rational and instructive entertainment and of artistic enjoyment</quote><bibCit></bibCit>for the people of East London.","Note: Unlike the MLA style of documentation, there should be no space between the bibCit and whatever goes before it, whether that is a closing quote tag or end-of-sentence punctuation. There is no space between the end of the quote and the beginning of the bibCit, but there is a space after the bibCit before the following word.","If a single source is quoted multiple times in one sentence, the bibCit should immediately follow the end of the sentence. Note: if source is used to supply information beyond the quotation, then a bibCit must ALSO be included according to standard bibCit practice.","If a person other than the author of the work cited in the bibCit is quoted then use the QtdInYes value on the \"qtd. in\" attributes for the bibCit. If both the author of the of the work cited in the bibCit and another person are quoted in a single quote tag, then embed one quote tag inside another. Do not adopt \"qtd. in\" practice for such examples.","Page ranges should not repeat #s (e.g. 65-6 NOT 65-66)","Every quote should have a bibCit.","\"Qtd. in\" should be represented in the attribute when necessary.","When you use the abbreviation ff in a bibCit, it does not need a period.","Spacing should read properly when the bibCit is removed.","If you are using two books by one author in the same document, use short titles to distinguish between the two: lastname short title ##. Ensure that you are providing the correct dbref number for each separate work in the respective dbref attribute.","BLC shelfmarks. There is no need to include shelfmarks for 20th century material unless something is very rare. Our practice on this project has been to use them when necessary--for rare early material and more often for nineteenth-century material--but this inconsistent approach does not present any problems.","Here's how you should handle information that is derived from a footnote in your primary source:","Crook 127n9","It takes no punctuation and no spaces (except between the author's last name and the page reference). You should use this only when the information you are using has been taken from the footnote.","Here's how you should handle citations from continuously paginated multi-volume references: short title volume number (year): page number","Athanæum 1370 (1854): 117","Include the year where possible. If you have only the year or only the volume, then use the following guide:","Punch 254: 62","TLS 1963: 941","If you are working with a multi-volume text whose page numbers begin at one with each new volume, then follow this guide: Publication volume/issue# (year): page number. So an example would look like this: Writers' Unlimited 12 (1999): 40.","For single volume alphabetically-arranged reference works, page numbers are not required provided that it is clear which article is being used. For example, biographical dictionaries do not require page numbers unless you are using an article about someone other than the subject of your document. Some examples of single-volume alphabetically arranged reference works which do not require page numbers are:","Q: How do I bibCit a book's publication as event when my source is the book itself? A: Don't worry about adding a bibCit in this situation; a researchNote specifying the source of the information (the title page of the book, for instance) will make more sense than trying to manufacture a bibCit.","For multi-volume reference works, include both volume and page numbers. You must also specify which edition of the reference work you are using. This information does not need to appear in the bibcit itself, but it must appear in the corresponding bibrecord in the bibl db, and you must make sure that the dbref number you provide is for the correct edition."],"xhtml:ul":{"xhtml:li":["Berney, K.A., ed.
